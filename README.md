# Spring2021_Functional_Analysis_Paper
Latex code and PDF for my Spring 2021 DRP Report. This is a work in progress and will be updated intermittently as I add more examples and clean up the exposition. At present, it leans strongly towards linear algebraic concepts rather than the intriguing applications, a lean that will hopefully be fixed soon.
